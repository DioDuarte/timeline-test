# What I Like About My Implementation
## 1. Well-Structured and Maintainable Code

- Modular components with clear responsibilities (Timeline, Header, Controls, Grid)

- Context API for global state (zoom, language) avoiding prop drilling

- TypeScript everywhere for type safety and self-documenting code

- Organized folder structure by feature (components, hooks, utils)

## 2. Fluid User Experience

- Interactive timeline with:
  - Drag-to-scroll navigation
  - Event dragging/resizing
  - Intuitive zoom controls (day/week/month)
  - Quick navigation panel


- Full **internationalization support** (English/Portuguese)

## 3. Scalable Architecture
- Complex logic isolated in custom hooks (`useDragScroll`, `useZoomControl`)

- Performance optimizations:
  - Memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - IntersectionObserver for infinite scrolling

- Theme system with styled-components for consistent styling

## 4. Future-Ready Foundation
The architecture supports easy addition of:

- New languages (just add translations)

- Additional zoom levels (quarter, year)

- Real API integration (currently uses mock data)

# What I Would Change If Doing It Again


## 1. Testing Strategy
- Add comprehensive test coverage:

  - Unit tests for utils/date functions
  - Integration tests for components
  - E2E tests for critical workflows

## 2. Performance Enhancements
- Implement proper virtualization for long lists
- Add more aggressive memoization


## 3. Accessibility Improvements
- Add proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management

# Design Decisions
## Inspiration
- I studied several timeline implementations including:

    - Google Calendar (for zoom interactions)
    - Trello (for drag-and-drop behavior)
    - GitHub Contributions Graph (for compact visualization)

## Key Decisions

 - Zoom Levels: Chose day/week/month as most practical for common use cases

 - Lane System: Developed custom algorithm to prevent event overlaps

 - Infinite Scroll: Implemented sentinel-based loading instead of pagination

 - Mobile First: Designed for touch interactions from the start

# Testing Approach

## Expanded Test Plan Given More Time

```js 
// Sample test cases I would implement:

        describe('Timeline Interactions', () => {
        test('should prevent invalid date ranges when dragging', () => {
        // Verify drag validation logic
      });
    
        test('should maintain lane assignments after zoom change', () => {
        // Test consistency across zoom levels
        });
      });
    
        describe('Localization', () => {
        test('should format dates correctly in Portuguese', () => {
        expect(formatDate(new Date(), 'pt')).toMatch(/^\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4}$/);
        });
      });
```
    
## Testing Pyramid Goal:
- 70% unit tests (utils, hooks)

- 20% integration tests (component interactions)

- 10% E2E tests (critical user journeys)

#  Timeline Project Setup Guide
## 📋 Prerequisites
 - Node.js (version 16.x or higher)
 - npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
 - Git (optional, for repository cloning)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### 1. Install Dependencies
#### First, install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Development Environment
#### To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

### 3. Production Build
#### To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

# 🌐 Accessing the Project
### After starting with npm start, the application will be available at: http://localhost:3000

# 🛠 Troubleshooting
### If you encounter errors:

#### 1. Try deleting the node_modules folder and running npm install again

#### 2. Verify you're using the correct Node.js version

#### 3. Check the error logs in the terminal for more details
